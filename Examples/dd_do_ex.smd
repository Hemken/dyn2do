Using <<dd_do>>
===============

Let us consider an example where we study the **mpg** and **weight** variables
in **auto.dta**.  In our examples below, we will first write the commands so
that they will be displayed in our target HTML file.  Then, we will write the
commands so that Stata will process the Stata dynamic tags, displaying the
results of the Stata commands in the target HTML file.

~~~~
<<dd_ignore>>
<<dd_do>>
sysuse auto, clear
describe
<</dd_do>>
<</dd_ignore>>
~~~~

This produces the following Stata results:

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
sysuse auto, clear
describe
<</dd_do>>
